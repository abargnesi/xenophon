## xenophon

This tool helps uncover interesting facts and moments in your git history.
It is named after the prominent, ancient greek historian [Xenophon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xenophon).

The initial plan is to provide two sub-commands:

<dl>
    <dt>synopsis</dt>
    <dd>summarize slices of commits</dd>
    <dt>synergy</dt>
    <dd>uncover similarity between independent branches</dd>
</dl>

Current status:
- Code is there to create a rudimentary `synopsis`.
- No code for `synergy` yet.
